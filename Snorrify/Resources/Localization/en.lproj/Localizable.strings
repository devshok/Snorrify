/*
 
 Hi. 游녦 It's a just reminder.
 If you gonna change something here
 like inserting a new termin
 or removing an old one
 
 You also need:
    1. Be ensure that you made `LocalizationKey` be convenient.
    2. And you edited `LocalizationTests` to cover your localization by unit tests.
    3. And did you synced this file for other locales? :)
 
 Sincerely, Ivan Shokurov.
